And if one looks throughout the history of our country and other free countries, it is the latter category that tend to be the difficult ones.

    "+ A set of functions that give values to each variable based on the values of all other variables.\n",

    "Suppose that we are trying to study the causal relationships between a treatment $X$ and lung function $Y$ for individuals who suffer from asthma.\n",
    "However, it is plausible that $Y$ also depends on the air pollution levels $Z$.\n",
    "The final ingredient is the set of function that connects $X$ and $Z$ to $Y$.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "Y = f(X, Z).\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graphical representation of causal models\n",
    "Every SCM is corresponds to a *graphical causal model*.\n",
    "These are usually *directed acyclic graphs* (DAGs).\n",

    "That is why such problems are also called **inverse problems**.\n",

    "In this example, imagine that we put sensors on the suspension of the trailer to measure the amplitude of oscillation.\n",
    "Now, the amplitude we measure is not exactly the prediction of the model.\n",
    "Why is that?\n",
    "First, there is observation noise.\n",
    "Second, our model has a systematic error (e.g., we have completely ignored any dumping effects).\n",
    "So, *the measurement is not the same as the model prediction*.\n",
    "This means that we need to add one more node to the graphical representation of the model.\n",
    "The new node, let's call it $X_m$ is the result of the measurement."

    "+ lack of data;\n",
    "+ the existence of measurement noise;\n",
    "+ the fact that the model is just not perfect.\n",

We are going to represent uncertainty on parameters by assigning a probability density on them. There are systematic ways of estimating the uncertainty induced because of the calibration process, but this will not concern us now.\n",
